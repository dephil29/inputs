input controls in react come in 2 flavors:

1. controlled inputs - programmer responsible for controlling
state

state: value and callback function that gets passed in
as props. parent component is responsible for reacting
to changes and passing updated value to child component

 -> box: Hello Worl
  user types "d"
 -> input calls onChange prop
  onChange calls handle Change
 -> state is updated
  setState triggers

2.
